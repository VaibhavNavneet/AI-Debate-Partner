# AI-Debate-Partner

**AI-Debate-Partner** is an AI-powered tool for simulating and analyzing debate scenarios, designed to help users practice and improve their argumentation skills using advanced language models.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AI-Driven Debate Simulation:** Generates realistic debate responses using large language models (LLMs).
- **Custom Debate Dataset:** Leverages a specially formatted JSONL dataset (`debate_ai_llama2_formatted.jsonl`) for high-quality, context-aware arguments.
- **Modular Python Implementation:** Core logic is implemented in `ai_debate_modele.py` for streamlined execution and easy integration.
- **Efficient Data Pipeline:** Includes scripts for data preprocessing (`datatrans.py`), dataset handling (`dataset.py`), and file management (`unzip.py`).
- **Reproducible Environment:** All dependencies are managed through `requirements.txt`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **PyTorch** (for model training and inference)
- **Large Language Models** (e.g., Llama 2)
- **JSONL** (data storage and processing)
- **Standard Python libraries** for data handling and preprocessing

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:** Debate data is preprocessed and transformed for LLM compatibility.
2. **Model Training/Inference:** The main script demonstrates how to fine-tune or use a pre-trained LLM to generate debate arguments.
3. **Interactive Debating:** Users can input topics or statements and receive AI-generated counterpoints for practice and analysis.
