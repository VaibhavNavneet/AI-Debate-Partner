# AI-Debate-Partner

**AI-Debate-Partner** is an advanced AI-powered tool designed to simulate debate scenarios, enabling users to practice, analyze, and enhance their debating skills using state-of-the-art language models.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **AI-Driven Debate Simulation:** Generates realistic debate responses on a wide range of topics using large language models (LLMs).
- **Custom Dataset:** Utilizes a curated and formatted debate dataset (`debate_ai_llama2_formatted.jsonl`) for high-quality, context-aware arguments.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook:** Main logic implemented in `ai_debate_model.ipynb` for easy experimentation and demonstration.
- **Modular Data Handling:** Includes scripts (`dataset.py`, `datatrans.py`, `unzip.py`) for efficient data preprocessing and management.
- **Reproducible Environment:** All dependencies specified in `requirements.txt` for hassle-free setup.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python** (primary language)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for development and demonstration)
- **LLM Integration:** Compatible with models like Llama 2 for generating debate responses
- **JSONL Format:** Efficient, scalable data storage and processing

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:** Debate data is preprocessed and transformed for LLM compatibility.
2. **Model Training/Inference:** The notebook demonstrates how to fine-tune or use a pre-trained LLM to generate debate arguments.
3. **Interactive Debating:** Users can input topics or statements and receive AI-generated counterpoints for practice and skill improvement.
